Main content will be added to DisorderCategories.py

v1: the basic rules setup has been created and can be seen in class rules in DisorderCategories.py.
v2: the agent data recovery mechanism and context analyzer has been partially implemented in the agent class and the read and write 
agents functions.
v3: sentiment analysis for responses to queries would be implemented as APIs in textblobtests.py. These will be used to return the type of output to the agent and the reason for such an output.
